# Programming beginners
## Lesson 1 Getting started
1. We need to install GIT

   * Windows:
https://git-for-windows.github.io/

   * Mac:
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#mac-os-x

   * Now create a dir for your repositories (repos). 

     - Open a cmd line and cd to that dir.

     - Run this: "git clone 
https://github.com/SteveBeaney/coding_class.git"

     - Now look at the repos dir in your file viewer.  

2. We need to install an editor:

   * Windows: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.1.html

   * Mac: https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html

3. If you don't have chrome we need it too:

   * Windows: https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/browser/features.html

   * Mac: https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/browser/features.html

We will review a simple linear program. A program is a simple sequence of steps. 
## Lesson 2 Variables
1. Open a cmd line and cd to the repos/coding_class dir.

     - Run this: "git reset --hard" then "git pull"
     - this refreshes the files in case any have been updated

Introducing simple numerical variables. Variables represent a value, 
this value can change.
That they 'vary' between different values is where the name comes from. 
We can also perform arithmetic on variables.
The perimeter of a quadrilateral (square or rectangle etc) is 2 * (x + y) or 2 * x + 2 * y . The area of a square or rectangle is x * y .

## Lesson 3 Looping
1. Open a cmd line and cd to the repos/coding_class dir.

     - Run this: "git reset --hard" then "git pull"
     - this refreshes the files in case any have been updated

This is a simple lesson. We look at 2 cases of repeating an action: 
- repeating for an exact number of times (iterations). E.g. drawing 10 squares.
- repeating until something happens or while something is happening.

## Lesson 4 Functions
1. Open a cmd line and cd to the repos/coding_class dir.

     - Run this: "git reset --hard" then "git pull"
     - this refreshes the files in case any have been updated

Because we know about loops and arithmetic on variables. It is possible for us to draw mathematical shapes and see what mathematics looks like. We will need functions for this.

## Lesson 5 Decisions
1. Open a cmd line and cd to the repos/coding_class dir.

     - Run this: "git reset --hard" then "git pull"
     - this refreshes the files in case any have been updated

## Lesson 6 User input
1. Open a cmd line and cd to the repos/coding_class dir.

     - Run this: "git reset --hard" then "git pull"
     - this refreshes the files in case any have been updated
## Lesson 7 Animations
1. Open a cmd line and cd to the repos/coding_class dir.

     - Run this: "git reset --hard" then "git pull"
     - this refreshes the files in case any have been updated
